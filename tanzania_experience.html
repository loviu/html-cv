    <h1>Tanzania Volunteering</h1>
    
        <h2>First day</h2>
        <p>When I was in college, in the first year, an opportunity came in and I was able to travel with a team of students and our leaders <br>
        in a trip in Tanzania for one month, a country from the South Eastern Africa, near the Indian Ocean. In that place we had to do several activities that we have planned from before. <br>
        In the first day we went to a children house where we have played and got to know them a little bit. Most of them didn't speak english or any known language to us <br>
        But even though we couldn't understand verbally, we did nonverbally, by our movement, our eyes and our hearts. I keep cherising those moments even now. <br>
        Their eyes, their smiles, their happiness and eager to know white people. So, in the first day, we got to rest and plan the things that we were going to do in the next day.</p>

        <h2>The following 3 days</h2>
        <p>We split in two teams. One that was going to the school and spend time with children, try to learn them mathematics, english and other disciplines and another team <br>
        that had to go to the playing field and to play sports with them because they like sports a lot, so learning discipline through sportsmanship is a great way. <br>
        Well, I was in the team that was going to schools. In the first day, me and another teammate, gathered up and discussed some things about a project that I was supposed to do in the following day. <br>
        The discussion was about a database for the library we were going to start in that school. In 2 days, I managed to make a little database in Microsoft Access in which <br>
        We were able to register 1200 books in the first day, in english language and in the other day, another 1000+ books in swahili language. <br>
        After we finished with arranging the books on shelves, getting the database ready and opening the library officially, we had planned to do lots of activities in that place. <br>
        So, in the following day, the girls teammates started an activity in which they gathered children and drew with them, sang and read, while I kept a little corner in which I gathered the smart children. <br>
        And because of my passion for chess, I started a little chess club in which I learned them the basics of chess and we got to play 2-3 days.</p>

        <h2>Days 5-7</h2>
        <p>After the first days, we took one day off and went to the Indian Ocean. By the way, amazing water and amazing sights to see! The sunrise and the sunset are incredible. <br>
        We spent some time at the beach and, in the evening, we came back in the camp and gathered with all the people from the place, to praise God and have a little time to talk and know with each other. <br>
        Beate, the chief of the reservation, is an amazing woman with lots of experiences with God and His work. We got to hear some incredible moments from her life and how she got to voluteering in african countries, <br>
        Even though she was german.
        In the next day, it was sunday, so, our team went to a local school and made a little program with the children where they sang, we sang, we read from the Bible, <br>
        two persons from our group had to share their experiences with God and feel good together in God's spirit.</p>
        
        <h2>The following days</h2>
        <p>We have prepared some activities for the children house, so, in the next day, we went to the children house and spent a full day playing with children, learning their names, <br>
        learning their capabilities and whom which we could continue our work of teaching.
        Between all these, in every evening, I was appointed to do classes with the teachers from the local school in which I have learned them how to write on keyboard, to work with Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel,  Microsoft Access and Microsoft Powerpoint. <br>
        The following day we went to a school that was situated far away from our camp to spend some time with the children from that place, where we met a girl that was really intelligent and eager to learn and go to college. <br>
        And we ended up sponsoring that girl with money for college, together with other two children.</p>

        <p>In every evening, I would take 4-5 laptops with me and carry them to school to have classes with the teachers and have a great time with them playing with the Microsoft Suite. <br>
        In the next day, we went in the reservation and helped the locals with planting, working the field, doing regular work and talk to them. <br>
        Every day, one person from our team had to be the leader and plan everything we would do in that day, split the people and send them where they would do better. So, we had to get to know our teammates really well <br>
        So we could place them in a good spot and be efficient in every job we did. We had to paint the children house, the library and the school, where we had a lot of fun.<br>
        In the last day, two people from the team that went to Tanzania before us, couldn't come because they had their engagement in Romania, so they sent some money to throw a party for them in Tanzania. <br>
        We had a lot of food, drinks, music and time to play with children.</p>
        
        <h3>It was a little experience that got me closer to God, closer to people and more engaging with social life and people, <br>
            How to pass language barriers and to understand people better. I learned that I didn't have to do all the work and that delegating people is a proefficient and good thing to do.
